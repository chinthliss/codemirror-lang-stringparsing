[daily cum amount of [player]]
[daily milk amount of [player]]
    Will be replaced with the amount of cum or milk produced by the target per day. Note that similiar to the 'length of' parsing, the value here will always be returned in liters, not your chosen units.

   Results in the transform of (part) on (form)
   Cannot be used in player-descs

[hp of [player]]
   Shows the current hp of the target as a percentage (for 100% it shows 100, 50% it shows 50, etcetera)
   ALWAYS use [if [hp of [player]] when determining the hp of a [victor] or [loser] in Victory, oVictory, and Defeat messages

[the infection test of [player]
   Returns a number from 0 to 7 denoting how many infection slots matched the infection/regex

[status (status name) of [player]]

See help string parsing/weather for the available data.

Moon Phases:
[moon phase] will return the phase the moon is in right now.
[moon phase capitalized] will return the phase of the moon with capitalized first letters.

Comments:
[comment=(text)]
[description=(text)]
Both of these, when run through stringparsing, are simply removed. They must not have [ or ] in their text anywhere.
comment is used primarily to comment on your code
description is used when power statuses are complicated by string parsing and need a neat description to be displayed instead

[stat (stat name) of [player]]
   Show a stat

[account stat (stat name)]
   Show the player's account stat

[lstat (stat name) of [player]]
   Show a lstat instead of a system-stat
   These are used to return player-set stats and check them in [if ] statements

[end]
   Used in Victory, oVictory, and Defeat to end the processing in that block if [end] remains after displaying that block
   ONLY use for multi-line messages! These are not necessary unless you require a line break
